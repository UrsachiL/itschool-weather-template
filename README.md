itschool-weather : 
A simple and user-friendly weather application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app displays the current temperature and a 5-day weather forecast for a set of predefined Romanian cities: Bucharest, Timișoara, Oradea, Cluj, and Sibiu. Users can select one of these cities and view accurate and up-to-date weather information using a clean and responsive interface.

The project is deployed here: https://cum-e-vremea-la-tine-in-oras.netlify.app
